TODO:
1. add some structure to the folders so that people know how to add stuff


## API Testing

Everything in the API Testing folder should be designed to test the flexibility of our APIs
in one way or another. They should be quick to run, so that they can be included in CI
without grinding our pipelines to a halt.



## Benchmarking

Benchmarks -- how fast does stuff run, and how much memory does it use? These can't easily
be included in CI at the minute because they'll take ages to run. Maybe we want to move
towards this though?



## Other

Interesting stuff that doesn't fit into the above categories.
